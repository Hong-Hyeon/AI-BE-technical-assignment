"""
Node implementations for talent analysis workflow.

This module contains individual node implementations extracted
from the original monolithic workflow file for better maintainability.

Available nodes:
- DataLoaderNode: Load talent data from sources
- ContextPreprocessorNode: Preprocess company and news context
- VectorSearchNode: Perform vector search for relevant context
- EducationAnalysisNode: Analyze education background
- PositionAnalysisNode: Analyze work positions
- AggregationNode: Aggregate results into final output
